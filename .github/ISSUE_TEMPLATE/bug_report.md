### Instructions
1. Enable debug mode in Homebridge
2. Reproduce the issue so that it appears in the logs
3. Upload a '.txt' file of your logs to this issue. ( Logs from screenshots, in '.rtf' format, or pasted directly into the post make debugging extremely difficult. Please just upload the file. )

[e.g. While using the HomeKit app on iPhone, after setting a MagicHome light tile's brightness to 0%, the tile will not respond again to brightness or color changes until after clicking the tile on again.

1. Attempt to increase brightness and change color
1. Observe that the light is unresponsive
1. Tap the MagicHome light's tile on>off>on
1. Observe that the light is now responsive again

### Expected behavior
