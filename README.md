## About

A Homebridge plugin for a range of Magic Home Wi-Fi lights and LED controllers.

## Installation

First, install the plugin globally.

````
npm install -g homebridge-magichome-dynamic-platform
````

## Use

* This plugin automatically detects MagicHome bulbs and controllers just like the Magichome app, and it should do so when you first run Homebridge. No more setting individual IP addresses per device.

* If a device has changed its IP Address, such as after a power outage, this plugin will update that device with the new IP on the next restart. Maintaining the device's associated timers, scenes, etc.

* If you'd like to remove an individual device, add the word 'delete' to any part of its name in Homekit and restart homebridge. This can be useful if you are intentionally taking a device offline or if you would simply like to reset it. Keep in mind, if it is still turned on during the homebridge restart, it will be detected and added again.

## User Interface

When the retical moves closer to the center of the color wheel, the saturation % drops. Once the retical passes the threshold (default 50%) it will switch to white mode or color and white mode depending on the device and config settings. See below for more details.

* **RGBWW 5 Channel LED Strip Controller (RGB and Two Whites)** In the color wheel, move the retical from cyan to red. This will transition the LEDs in this pattern:
```Color-Only>Color and Cold-White>Cold-White Only>Cold-White and Warm-White>Warm-White Only>Color and Warm-White>Color-Only```

* **RGBWW 5 Channel LED Lightbulb (RGB and Two Whites)** In the color wheel, move the retical from cyan to red. This will transition the LEDs in this pattern:
```Color-OnlyCold-White Only>Cold-White and Warm-White>Warm-White Only>Color-Only```

* **RGBWW 4 Channel LED Strip Controller (RGB and  One White)** In the color wheel, move the retical from cyan to red. This will transition the LEDs in this pattern:
```Color-Only>Color and White>White Only>Color and White>Color-Only```

* **RGBW 4 Channel LED Lightbulb (RGB and One White)** In the color wheel, move the retical from cyan to red. This will transition the LEDs in this pattern:
```Color-Only>White-Only>Color-Only```

* **RGB 3 Channel (RGB Only)** Normal RGB functionality.

## Configuration

Please setup your config in Config UI X under ```Plugins>Homebridge MagicHome Dynamic Platform>Settings.``` 
However the default settings should suffice. Please read below to learn more about the settings before changing anything.
