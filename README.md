# Homebridge MagicHome Dynamic Platform

This is a template Homebridge platform plugin and can be used as a base to help you get started developing your own plugin.

This template should be use in conjunction with the [developer documentation](https://developers.homebridge.io/). A full list of all supported service types, and their characteristics is available on this site.

## Clone As Template

Click the link below to create a new GitHub Repository using this template, or click the *Use This Template* button above.

### [Create New Repository From Template](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-plugin-template/generate)

</span>

## Setup Development Environment

To develop Homebridge plugins you must have Node.js 12 or later installed, and a modern code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This plugin template uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to make development easier and comes with pre-configured settings for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and ESLint. If you are using VS Code install these extensions:

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)

## Install Development Dependencies

Using a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run this command to install the development dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Update package.json

Open the [`package.json`](./package.json) and change the following attributes:

* `name` - this should be prefixed with `homebridge-` or `@username/homebridge-` and contain no spaces or special characters apart from a dashes
* `displayName` - this is the "nice" name displayed in the Homebridge UI
* `repository.url` - Link to your GitHub repo
* `bugs.url` - Link to your GitHub repo issues page

When you are ready to publish the plugin you should set `private` to false, or remove the attribute entirely.

## Update Plugin Defaults

Open the [`src/settings.ts`](./src/settings.ts) file and change the default values:

* `PLATFORM_NAME` - Set this to be the name of your platform. This is the name of the platform that users will use to register the plugin in the Homebridge `config.json`.
* `PLUGIN_NAME` - Set this to be the same name you set in the [`package.json`](./package.json) file. 

Open the [`config.schema.json`](./config.schema.json) file and change the following attribute:

* `pluginAlias` - set this to match the `PLATFORM_NAME` you defined in the previous step.

## Build Plugin

TypeScript needs to be compiled into JavaScript before it can run. The following command will compile the contents of your [`src`](./src) directory and put the resulting code into the `dist` folder.

```
npm run build
```

## Link To Homebridge

Run this command so your global install of Homebridge can discover the plugin in your development environment:

```
npm link
```

You can now start Homebridge, use the `-D` flag so you can see debug log messages in your plugin:

```
homebridge -D
```

## Watch For Changes and Build Automatically

If you want to have your code compile automatically as you make changes, and restart Homebridge automatically between changes you can run:

```
npm run watch
```

This will launch an instance of Homebridge in debug mode which will restart every time you make a change to the source code. It will the config stored in the default location under `~/.homebridge`. You may need to stop other running instances of Homebridge while using this command to prevent conflicts. You can adjust the Homebridge startup command in the [`nodemon.json`](./nodemon.json) file.

## Publish Package

When you are ready to publish your plugin to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), make sure you have removed the `private` attribute from the [`package.json`](./package.json) file then run:

```
npm publish
```

If you are publishing a scoped plugin, i.e. `@username/homebridge-xxx` you will need to add `--access=public` to command the first time you publish.

## Versioning Your Plugin

Given a version number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`, such as `1.4.3`, increment the:

1. **MAJOR** version when you make breaking changes to your plugin,
2. **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
3. **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.
